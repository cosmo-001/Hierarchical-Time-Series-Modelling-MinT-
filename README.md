# Hierarchical-Time-Series-Modelling-MinT-
Hierarchical time series modelling is a concept that entails predicting coherent forecasts for time series data that have a hierarchical structure. Maintaining coherency across the hierarchy is a major challenge for hierarchical time series modelling. The Hierarchical Mixture Networks (HINT) framework is one framework that has been proposed for efficient and accurate coherent forecasting. This project aims to compare the performance of different reconciliation techniques in forecasting retail sales volumes using the HINT framework. The techniques chosen are the bottom-up and minimum trace algorithms which will be evaluated using the scaled continuous ranked probability score (sCRPS), root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) metric. We prove that the reconciliation techniques chosen perform better at lower levels of a hierarchy compared to the aggregate levels. This code is for the minimum trace reconciliation technique. This code can be run on Google Colab. The 'neuralforecast' package will need to be installed using the following command: !pip install neuralforecast
